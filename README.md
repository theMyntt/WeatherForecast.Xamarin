## Warnings

### Why I used INotifyPropertyChanged instead of ObservableObject (CommunityToolkit.MVVM)

- The version that I worked dont support the Toolkit, so I had to resort to more "primitive" options

### .NET Standard 2.0

- I dont know why but in csproj, the version of .NET is 2.0 but im working with .NET 7.3
